# clamp
This project was active between 2005 and 2008 and is no longer maintained since then. At this time, winamp was a popular mp3 player on MS Windows but it lacked command line features. Some other projects have been started to achieve this like PlayNow, Clever, WACommand, DOSAmp but I preferred writing my own one, using my preferred language at this time, Delphi 7 from Borland.

When the project was active, I received some requests for source code, but declined because I was not happy with the code, not as clean as I would like. The code will no longer change now and it is unlikely anyone is still interested in it. I am not even sure this the ultimate version (version 1.15 can be found on the web, this one is labelled 1.14) but this is the latest I have kept. Anyway, you'll find what I have and, if you are interested in it, you can do whatever you feel like with this code, it's free for whatever use, with no support and provided as is.

Feel free to drop me an email at clamptool at gmail.com

Thanks for reading.
